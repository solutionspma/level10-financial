### What to Say:
> "We're building a coaching-driven bankability platform. Credit data is used strictly for evaluation, education, and prequalification. Users explicitly authorize pulls, we log every access, and we never resell data. Industry-leading credit bureaus are core to helping underserved entrepreneurs understand *why* they're not fundable — and exactly how to fix it."
